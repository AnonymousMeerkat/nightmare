// 2 lines of code.
// Yeah. 2. freaking. lines. of. code.
// In one file.

// If you've ever seen black rock shooter or amnesia (the anime) and liked it, let me know.
// Currently, those are my favourite animes :)

// Black rock shooter got mixed reviews, for whatever reason ... I can _kind of_ understand why,
//  it's very confusing (I still have to rewatch it to understand wtf is going on xD), but omg, it's freaking
//  awesome!! It's just very dark, with some of the best fight scenes I've seen in any animated material, and pretty
//  neat plot twists. I just love it how small life issues are represented as something much bigger ...
// Gosh, it's so hard to explain why (this explantion gives it no justice), but I just freaking love it!!
// Oh! I almost forgot! The art, but mostly, the music!!!! It's REALLY awesome!! :D

// About Amnesia, the reason why I love it is that it has all of my favourite themes in one really well-made anime.
// Now, I haven't actually finished the series yet (currently on episode 5/13), but so far, it's amazing.
// Why? Well, first, I LOVE the character designs. Second, it's a reverse harem that's just dark the entire way through,
//  not horror, but has absolutely no comedy whatsoever. It doesn't even have any really "light" moments .... even the best
//  moments are .... just not right.
// The aesthetic is just amazing, and considering that it has a nonlinear plot, deals with lost and mixed up memories,
//  time travelling, and parallel worlds (pretty much all of my favourite themes in a movie) ... it's just ... amazing!!
// Not to mention that the soundtrack is quite interesting (fits it perfectly) and the opening and ending themes are
//  some of my favourites all-time (maybe the Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica ending theme would be slightly higher ... maybe)

// If you like either, or want to know more, or whatever, feel free to chat here (via github comments or anything), I'd love
//  to have someone to talk with about these x3

Level format draft
==================

Here's the basic level format that I was thinking (tree'd):

ponyville/
├── 0.png
├── 1.png
├── info.yasl
├── m1m.png
├── m1.png
└── m2.png

Each .png represents a z level. 0 is where the player is (so 1 is in front). m1 is minus 1 (m2 is minus 2, obviously XD).
M1 would be the background, while M2 would be the sub-background (so you can go into the background to hide).
We can theoretically have unlimited z levels.

m1m.png is minus 1 mask. For this, each object in it is color-coded. For example, a drawer would be #ff0000, another drawer would be #fe0000, etc... The colors don't matter as long as they're unique.

info.yasl is the level info. It could be something like:


    left = "scc", (If you go to the left of the level, you'll go to the 'scc' level)
    right = "library", (I think you can get what's going on here xP)
    m1m = { (Data for the minus 1 mask)
        #ff0000 = { (This if for the '#ff0000' color. '#' is legal in a symbol name, btw)
            type = "message" (message box or something),
            message = "This drawer is empty"
        },
        #fe0000 = {
            type = "message",
            message = "You found a dirty sock!",
            inventory = "dirtysock" (I'm just making stuff up here. This, in my made up world, adds the "dirtysock" item to your inventory. Dirtysock might be declared in a .yasl file too [i.e. not in-game])
        },
        #00ff00 = {
            type = "hallucination", (Just doing random stuff here. We don't need to have this type)
            duration = 5.5 (5.5 seconds, I guess)
        }
    }

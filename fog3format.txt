.fog3 file specification:

8 byte header:

0-2: magic (0x1E3D .... with 1E being a horrible 1337 of "F" lol)
2-4: width      -\
3-6: height      | - All of these are signed integers
6-8: breadth    -/

Contents are 8-bit unsigned integers, ordered ZYX ..... i.e. X: 5, Y: 3, Z: 2 from an image 128x128x128 would be at position (128*128)*2 + 128*3 + 5 = 33157 in the contents (33165 if you include the file header).
